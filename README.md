# AM_particle_detection
Algorithmic detection of particles on Additively Manufactured (3D printed) struts

This code is used to acquire and analyse attached particles and particle clusters on Additively Manufactured (AM) strut elements. 

It was developed within the RMIT University Advanced Manufacturing Precinct. 

The methodology was published as "Algorithmic Detection And Categorization Of Partially Attached Particles In AM Structures: A Non-Destructive Method For The Certification Of Lattice Implants". The publication can be located with the following Digital Object Identifier (DOI) = DOI: 10.1108/RPJ-07-2022-0225
