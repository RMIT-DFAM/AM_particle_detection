Provided in the "Raw_Datasets" subfolder are the CT image datasets that have been used in conjunction with this work.

In the higher level folders, the projection data for the three struts (at angles of 30°, 60° and 90° respectively) has been uploaded.
In the lower level folders, the reconstructed slice data for the three struts (at angles of 30°, 60° and 90° respectively) has been uploaded.

Note: because the number of images in the reconstructed slice data folders exceed 1,000, the repository should be cloned or downloaded as a ZIP to ensure each image file is able to be downloaded.

The reconstructed slice data for each dataset was used in Particle_Detection_Algorithm_v6.m, specifcally using Startup Option One (starting from the reconstruction slice data and associated reconstruction log file respectively.
